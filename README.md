# Complex Number – Java Project

This is a small Java project where I created a class to represent complex numbers and perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

## 🧠 What it does

- Defines a `ComplexNumber` class with real and imaginary parts
- Implements simple operations between two complex numbers
- Displays the result in the usual `a + bi` format

The `main1.java` file contains a few examples to test how the class works.

## 💻 Why I made this

I built this project to practice object-oriented programming in Java, and also to apply mathematical concepts (complex numbers) in code. It helped me better understand how to structure classes and methods in a clean and reusable way.

## ▶️ How to run it

Make sure you have Java installed.

In the terminal, run:

```bash
javac ComplexNumber.java main1.java
java main1
